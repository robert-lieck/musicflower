Triangular Maps
===============

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 7-10

The array returned by :func:`~musicflower.loader.load_file` contains the triangular map of pitch-class distributions.
To use NumPy's efficient linear storage, it is flattened by starting at the top and then going row by row, thus, it
contains a total number of :math:`n(n+1)/2` pitch-class distributions.

    from musicflower.loader import load_file

    scape = load_file(data='Prelude_No._1_BWV_846_in_C_Major.mxl', n=resolution)
    print(scape.shape)
    print(resolution * (resolution + 1) / 2)

To handle this kind of flattened triangular maps, the :class:`~triangularmap.tmap.TMap` class from the
`TriangularMap <https://github.com/robert-lieck/triangularmap>`_ package can be used. It takes
a linear storage and allows for efficiently accessing its content as if it was a triangular map (see the
`TriangularMap documentation <https://robert-lieck.github.io/triangularmap/>`_ for more details).
For multidimensional arrays, the first dimension is assumed to represent the triangular map.

The functionalities include slicing at a specific level/depth (this returns *views* of the underlying storage)

and slicing "skewed columns" for a specific start/end index (this returns *copies* of the underlying storage, note the
different syntax using square brackets), which always run left-to-right (i.e. bottom-up for start-slices, top-down for
end-slices)
